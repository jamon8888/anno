# Abstract Anaphora Resolution: A Research Gap Analysis

## The Problem

Standard coreference resolution links **noun phrases** to their antecedents:

```
"John went to the store. He bought milk."
       ^^^^                ^^
       antecedent          pronoun (links to "John")
```

**Abstract anaphora** is fundamentally different - it links pronouns like "this", "that", "it" to **events, propositions, or situations**, not noun phrases:

```
"Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. This caused inflation to spike."
        ^^^^^^^                  ^^^^
        EVENT                    abstract anaphor (links to the INVASION EVENT)
```

The referent of "This" is not "Russia" or "Ukraine" - it's the entire **invasion event**.

## Why Current Methods Fail

### 1. Mention-Ranking Architecture Mismatch

Standard neural coref (Lee et al. 2017, SpanBERT-coref) enumerates **noun phrase spans** as candidate mentions. Events are not noun phrases - they're triggered by verbs or nominalized forms that don't fit the span enumeration heuristics.

### 2. Coreference Training Data Excludes Events

OntoNotes - the dominant coref benchmark - does **not annotate event coreference**. Systems trained on OntoNotes learn to ignore event-pronoun links entirely.

### 3. The Scope Problem

"This" can refer to:
- A single clause: "He fell. This hurt."
- A sentence: "The merger failed spectacularly. This surprised analysts."
- Multiple sentences: "First A happened. Then B happened. This cascade led to C."
- An implicit consequence: "Oil prices rose. This [the economic impact] affected consumers."

The scope is **pragmatically determined** - there's no syntactic signal for where the antecedent ends.

## Taxonomy of Abstract Referents

| Type | Example | Referent |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Event** | "The crash happened. This shocked everyone." | The crash event |
| **Fact** | "He won. This is undeniable." | The fact that he won |
| **Proposition** | "She might leave. This worries me." | The possibility of leaving |
| **Situation** | "Prices rose while wages fell. This was unsustainable." | The combined state |
| **Manner** | "He spoke rudely. This annoyed her." | The manner of speaking |

## Current System Evaluation

### Test Setup

We evaluate `anno::eval::coref_resolver::SimpleCorefResolver` on:
1. **Nominal coref** (baseline): "John" → "he"
2. **Abstract anaphora**: "The invasion" → "This"

### Expected Results

- Nominal coref: ~70-80% accuracy (rule-based systems do well on simple cases)
- Abstract anaphora: ~0-10% accuracy (no mechanism to even detect events)

### Failure Modes

1. **No Event Detection**: Current resolver only considers entities from NER
2. **Pronoun Heuristics Fail**: "This" matches to nearest person/org, not to events
3. **No Discourse Structure**: No representation of clause/sentence boundaries

## Proposed Research Direction

### Phase 1: Quantify the Gap (This Document)

- Create evaluation dataset mixing nominal + abstract cases
- Run current resolver
- Generate failure analysis report

### Phase 2: Event Extraction Integration

- Add event triggers to `EntityCategory` (already has `Relation`)
- Extend `Mention` type to include event mentions
- Create `EventMention` struct parallel to entity mentions

### Phase 3: Discourse-Aware Resolution

- Implement Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) parsing
- Add "sentence" and "clause" level scope tracking
- Create `AbstractAntecedent` type that can point to discourse units

### Phase 4: Evaluation on Benchmark

- Evaluate on ARRAU corpus (has abstract anaphora annotations)
- Compare to neural baselines (SpanBERT-coref, LingMess)

## Benchmark Data Formats

### Marasović et al. JSON Format

The standard format for abstract anaphora data (from `abstract-anaphora-data` repo):

```json
{
  "anaphor_derived_from": "since-prp",      // Syntactic pattern source
  "anaphor_head": "that",                   // The anaphor word
  "anaphor_phrase": "because of that",      // Full anaphoric NP
  "antecedents": ["S clause text", ...],    // Positive candidates (gold)
  "antecedent_nodes": ["S", "VP"],          // Syntactic tags of antecedents
  "candidates": ["neg candidate 1", ...],   // Negative candidates (same sentence)
  "candidates_0": [...],                    // Neg candidates from anaphoric sentence
  "candidates_1": [...],                    // Neg candidates from sentence-1
  "prev_context": ["sent-1", "sent-2", ...] // 4 preceding sentences
}
```

### CODI-CRAC 2021 Evaluation

The shared task used:
- **Input**: Dialogue with utterance boundaries
- **Task**: Identify discourse deixis spans and link to antecedents
- **Metrics**: MUC, B³, CEAF, LEA (LEA preferred)
- **Baseline**: Lee et al. (2018) span-based coref
- **SOTA**: dd-utt model by Li & Ng (2022)

### Shell Noun Categories (Schmid 2000)

| Class | Examples | Typical Antecedent |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Factual | fact, reason, evidence, result | Event/Fact |
| Linguistic | claim, argument, answer, question | Proposition |
| Mental | idea, belief, thought, view | Proposition |
| Modal | possibility, chance, need, risk | Proposition |
| Eventive | event, incident, action, decision | Event |
| Circumstantial | situation, problem, case, issue | Situation |

### Human-Voice Agent Interaction Dataset

Location: `testdata/human_voice_agent/`

Why this matters: Most abstract anaphora research uses written text, but spoken
dialogue has unique phenomena:

- **Response tokens** ("uh huh", "oui") that standard coref ignores
- **Aside sequences** (whispered comments) with implicit addressee switching
- **Discourse deixis** in multi-turn context where "this" refers to events/propositions

| File | Records | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| `transcripts.jsonl` | 70 | French dialogue turns from Pepper robot & ChatGPT voice |
| `discourse_deixis.jsonl` | 10 | Abstract anaphora with character offsets |
| `response_tokens.jsonl` | 11 | Continuer/acknowledgment function labels |

### Recent Discourse Benchmarks (2023-2025)

Anno now includes entries for recent discourse evaluation datasets:

| Dataset | Year | Focus | Languages |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Disco-Bench** | 2023 | Document-level discourse (cohesion, coherence) | zh, en |
| **DiscoTrack** | 2025 | Multilingual discourse tracking (salience, bridging) | 12 languages |
| **LIEDER** | 2024 | Discourse entity recognition (existence, uniqueness, novelty) | en |
| **GCDC** | 2018 | Real-world discourse coherence across domains | en |
| **DISAPERE** | 2022 | Peer review discourse structure and argumentation | en |

Key insights from recent work:

- **DiscoTrack** (arXiv:2510.17013) shows that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with
  implicit information and pragmatic inference across documents
- **LIEDER** (arXiv:2403.06301) finds LLMs handle existence/uniqueness/plurality but
  fail on **novelty** - a fundamental discourse property
- **Disco-Bench** (arXiv:2307.08074) demonstrates discourse phenomena remain challenging
  even for 20+ transformer and LLM models
