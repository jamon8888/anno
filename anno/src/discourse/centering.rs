//! Centering Theory Implementation.
//!
//! # The Problem: Pronoun Resolution is Hard
//!
//! Consider: "John called Bill. He was angry."
//!
//! Who is "he"? Both John and Bill are grammatically valid. Humans resolve this
//! effortlessly, but the cues they use are subtle:
//!
//! - **Grammatical role**: Subjects are more likely to be re-mentioned
//! - **Recency**: Recent entities are more salient
//! - **Coherence**: Texts that maintain focus are easier to process
//!
//! Simple heuristics (nearest antecedent, subject preference) work sometimes,
//! but fail on texts with multiple entities or topic shifts. Centering theory
//! provides a principled framework for tracking *what the discourse is about*.
//!
//! # Why Centering Theory?
//!
//! Centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, Weinstein 1995) captures the observation that
//! coherent discourse maintains a consistent "center of attention." When you read:
//!
//! > "John went to the store. He bought milk. He drove home."
//!
//! ...you effortlessly track that all three sentences are about John. The theory
//! formalizes this intuition through forward-looking centers (entities mentioned)
//! and backward-looking centers (what the utterance is "about").
//!
//! **Key insight**: The most salient entity in one utterance is likely to be
//! referenced in the next. Violations of this expectation (topic shifts) create
//! processing difficulty—and are marked by explicit referring expressions.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! For each utterance U_n:
//!
//! - **Cf(U_n)**: Forward-looking centers — entities mentioned, ranked by salience
//! - **Cb(U_n)**: Backward-looking center — highest-ranked entity from Cf(U_{n-1})
//!   that is realized in U_n
//! - **Cp(U_n)**: Preferred center — highest-ranked member of Cf(U_n)
//!
//! The Cb answers: "What is this utterance about?"
//! The Cp predicts: "What will the next utterance likely be about?"
//!
//! # Transition Types
//!
//! | Transition | Cb(U_n) = Cb(U_{n-1}) | Cb(U_n) = Cp(U_n) |
//! |------------|----------------------|-------------------|
//! | CONTINUE   | Yes                  | Yes               |
//! | RETAIN     | Yes                  | No                |
//! | SMOOTH-SHIFT | No                 | Yes               |
//! | ROUGH-SHIFT | No                  | No                |
//!
//! **Preference ordering**: CONTINUE > RETAIN > SMOOTH-SHIFT > ROUGH-SHIFT
//!
//! This ordering predicts that CONTINUE transitions are easiest to process—
//! the discourse maintains focus on the same entity, which remains most salient.
//! ROUGH-SHIFTs are hardest: the topic changes to an entity that isn't even
//! the most prominent in the current utterance.
//!
//! # Centering + Recency: Modern Coreference
//!
//! Jiang et al. (2022) found vanilla CT provides little gain for neural coref,
//! but CT + recency captures more coreference signal. The combination works
//! because:
//!
//! 1. **CT captures structural salience** (grammatical role, information status)
//! 2. **Recency captures temporal decay** (recently mentioned = more accessible)
//!
//! This module implements both classical CT and the recency-augmented variant
//! via [`CenteringConfig::recency_decay`].
//!
//! # Connection to Israel (1994)
//!
//! Israel's critique of dynamic semantics noted that the "extent" of a discourse
//! referent is not statically determinable—you can't know at introduction time
//! how long an entity will remain relevant. Centering theory operationalizes this:
//! the extent of an entity is precisely how long it can serve as Cb. When it stops
//! appearing in Cf lists, it's effectively "garbage collected" from the discourse.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use anno::discourse::centering::{
//!     CenteringState, ForwardCenter, track_centers, CenteringConfig
//! };
//!
//! let utterances = vec![
//!     vec![
//!         ForwardCenter::new(1, "John", 1.0),
//!         ForwardCenter::new(2, "Mary", 0.8),
//!     ],
//!     vec![
//!         ForwardCenter::new(1, "he", 0.9),  // Refers to John
//!         ForwardCenter::new(3, "the book", 0.7),
//!     ],
//! ];
//!
//! let config = CenteringConfig::default();
//! let states = track_centers(&utterances, &config);
//!
//! // First utterance has no Cb (discourse-initial)
//! assert!(states[0].cb.is_none());
//!
//! // Second utterance: Cb = John (highest Cf from U1 realized in U2)
//! assert_eq!(states[1].cb, Some(1));
//! ```
