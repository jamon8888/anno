//! Phi-features (φ-features) for morphological agreement.
//!
//! In linguistics, phi-features (from Greek φ) are the grammatical features
//! that govern syntactic agreement between words. They're the reason verbs
//! conjugate differently for "I run" vs "she runs" in English, and why
//! adjectives must match nouns in gender and number in Spanish.
//!
//! # The Three Phi-Features
//!
//! | Feature | Values | Example (English) |
//! |---------|--------|-------------------|
//! | **Person** | 1st, 2nd, 3rd | "I" vs "you" vs "she" |
//! | **Number** | singular, dual, plural | "cat" vs "cats" |
//! | **Gender** | masculine, feminine, neuter | "he" vs "she" vs "it" |
//!
//! # Why This Matters for NLP
//!
//! Phi-features are critical for:
//!
//! 1. **Zero pronoun resolution** - In pro-drop languages (Arabic, Spanish,
//!    Japanese, Korean, Chinese), subjects/objects are routinely dropped.
//!    Phi-features from verb morphology let us recover what was omitted.
//!
//! 2. **Coreference constraints** - "John... she" is unlikely to corefer
//!    because of gender mismatch. Phi-features formalize these constraints.
//!
//! 3. **Joint entity models** - Factor graphs can use phi-feature compatibility
//!    as soft constraints between mention pairs.
//!
//! # Arabic Example
//!
//! Arabic is a canonical pro-drop language where the verb encodes subject features:
//!
//! ```text
//! ذَهَبَ إِلَى الْبَيْتِ
//! dhahaba ʾilā al-bayti
//! [he]-went to the-house
//! "He went to the house"
//! ```
//!
//! The verb "ذَهَبَ" (dhahaba) encodes:
//! - Person: 3rd (not the speaker, not the listener)
//! - Number: Singular (one person)
//! - Gender: Masculine (specifically "he", not "she")
//!
//! This allows us to create a zero mention with known phi-features even though
//! no pronoun appears in the text.
//!
//! # Cross-Linguistic Variation
//!
//! | Language | Dual Number | Verb Agreement | Pro-drop |
//! |----------|-------------|----------------|----------|
//! | Arabic | Yes | Person+Number+Gender | Yes |
//! | Spanish | No | Person+Number | Yes |
//! | Japanese | No | None (verbs don't conjugate) | Yes |
//! | English | No | Number only (3rd sg) | No |
//! | Sanskrit | Yes | Person+Number+Gender | Yes |
