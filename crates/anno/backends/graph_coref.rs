//! Graph-Based Coreference Resolution with Iterative Refinement.
//!
//! This module implements a graph-based approach to coreference resolution,
//! inspired by the Graph-to-Graph Transformer (G2GT) architecture from
//! Miculicich & Henderson (2022). The key insight: model coreference as a
//! graph where nodes are mentions and edges are coref links, then iteratively
//! refine predictions until convergence.
//!
//! # Historical Context
//!
//! Coreference resolution evolved through distinct paradigms:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1995-2010  Rule-based: Hobbs algorithm, centering theory
//! 2010-2016  Mention-pair: Classify (m_i, m_j) independently
//! 2017       Lee et al.: End-to-end span-based, O(N⁴) complexity
//! 2018       Lee et al.: Higher-order with representation refinement
//! 2022       G2GT: Graph refinement with global decisions, O(N² × T)
//! ```
//!
//! **The core problem with pairwise models**: Decisions are independent.
//! If P(A~B)=0.9 and P(B~C)=0.9, transitivity implies A~C, but pairwise
//! models can output P(A~C)=0.1. The G2GT approach addresses this by
//! conditioning each iteration on the full predicted graph from the previous
//! iteration, enabling global consistency.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Input: Detected mentions M = [m₁, m₂, ..., mₙ]
//!    ↓
//! ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! │ Iteration 0: Initialize empty graph G₀                  │
//! │    - Nodes: all mentions                                │
//! │    - Edges: none                                        │
//! └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//!    ↓
//! ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! │ Iteration t: Refine graph Gₜ₋₁ → Gₜ                     │
//! │    For each mention pair (mᵢ, mⱼ) where j < i:          │
//! │    1. Compute pairwise score s(mᵢ, mⱼ)                  │
//! │    2. Add graph context from Gₜ₋₁ (transitivity bonus)  │
//! │    3. Update edge if score exceeds threshold            │
//! └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//!    ↓ (repeat until Gₜ = Gₜ₋₁ or t = max_iterations)
//! ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! │ Extract clusters via connected components               │
//! └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//!    ↓
//! Output: Coreference chains (clusters)
//! ```
//!
//! # Approximation vs. Full G2GT
//!
//! This implementation is a **heuristic approximation**, not a full neural model.
//!
//! | Aspect | G2GT (Miculicich 2022) | This Implementation |
//! |--------|------------------------|---------------------|
//! | **Graph nodes** | Tokens | Mentions (pre-detected) |
//! | **Graph encoding** | Attention modification: `Lk = E(G)·Wk` | Explicit transitivity bonus |
//! | **Pairwise scoring** | Learned neural scorer | String/head heuristics |
//! | **Refinement** | Full neural re-prediction | Score adjustment |
//! | **Training** | End-to-end backprop | None (heuristic) |
//!
//! ## What We Preserve
//!
//! The key insight from G2GT: **iterative refinement with graph conditioning**
//! enables global consistency that independent pairwise models lack. Even with
//! heuristic scoring, the refinement loop propagates transitivity constraints.
//!
//! ## What We Lose
//!
//! - **Learned representations**: G2GT embeds graph structure directly into
//!   transformer attention. We approximate this with explicit bonuses.
//! - **End-to-end optimization**: G2GT trains the full system. We use fixed heuristics.
//! - **Token-level granularity**: G2GT operates on tokens; we operate on mentions.
//!
//! For production use with high accuracy requirements, consider a full neural
//! implementation or the T5-based coreference in `crate::backends::coref_t5`.
//!
//! # Usage with MentionType
//!
//! For best results, provide mentions with `mention_type` set:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use anno::backends::graph_coref::GraphCoref;
//! use anno::eval::coref::{Mention, MentionType};
//!
//! // Properly annotated mentions work better
//! let mut john = Mention::new("John", 0, 4);
//! john.mention_type = Some(MentionType::Proper);
//!
//! let mut he = Mention::new("he", 20, 22);
//! he.mention_type = Some(MentionType::Pronominal);
//!
//! let coref = GraphCoref::new();
//! let chains = coref.resolve(&[john, he]);
//! ```
//!
//! # Graph Initialization: Syntactic vs Semantic
//!
//! SpanEIT (Hossain et al. 2025) constructs a combined graph:
//! - **Syntactic edges** (`E_syn`): From dependency parse (adjectival modifiers, etc.)
//! - **Semantic edges** (`E_sem`): From co-occurrence statistics
//!
//! Use [`CorefGraph::seed_cooccurrence_edges`] to initialize with proximity-based
//! priors before running iterative refinement.

//! # Future Direction: Sheaf Neural Networks
//!
//! This implementation uses explicit transitivity bonuses to approximate global consistency.
//! A more principled approach: **Sheaf Neural Networks** replace scalar edge weights with
//! learned linear maps (restriction maps) and minimize the sheaf Dirichlet energy:
//!
//! ```text
//! E(x) = Σ_{(u,v) ∈ E} || F(u→v) · x_u - F(v→u) · x_v ||²
//! ```
//!
//! This enforces transitivity at the gradient level, not post-hoc. See:
